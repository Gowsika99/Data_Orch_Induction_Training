# About the Project
<
This repository is part of the Data Orch Induction Training Program where multiple team members collaborate to build a small modular application using Python and Git.
The goal of the project is to teach real-world development workflow such as branching, merging, feature isolation, documentation, and cross-team coordination.

System Components
The final application consists of four core modules developed by different roles:
    1. User Management
    Handles:
        Creating and validating users
        Restricting invalid usernames
        Tracking number of users in the system
        Removing users when needed
        
    2. Quiz Management
    Provides:
        Storage for quiz questions
        Ability to add quizzes dynamically
        Displaying today's quiz in the app
        Integrating quiz data into state management
        
    3. Scoring System
    Implements:
        A scoreboard for users
        Updating and storing scores
        Ensuring previous scores are not lost
    4. Application Control
    Responsible for:
        Project directory setup
        Entry-point management
        Unified application behaviour
        Final merging and structure alignment
    5. Documentation
    Ensures:
        Clean, well- structured documentation
        Proper markdown formattig
        Usage examples for end users
        A dynamic table of contents
        
Usage Examples
    1. Adding a New User
    The application allows you to add new users to the system. When a user is addes their name is stored in th euser list and total user count is updated accordingly.
    2. Adding a Quiz
    A quiz can be added by providing a question, a list of answer options, the correct answer, and the score value. The newly added quiz is stored within the quiz collection.
    3. Viewing the current Application State The application maintains a central state containing the number of users, total quizzes, and stored scores. This state can be viewed at any time to understand the current status of the system.>
