# Project Overview
This project is a simple quiz application. I implemented:
- A quiz data file with quiz questions.
- An add_quiz() function to store new quiz items.
- A credentials file containing username and demo password.
- A main.py file that controls the application.
- An app_state that keeps track of the number of quizzes.
- A start_app() function that prints the quiz in a formatted template.
